Under Armour has one mission: to make you better. The Brand was created on a football field in 1996 when University of Maryland special teams captain Kevin Plank looked down at his heavy, sweaty cotton T-shirt and thought: there has got to be something better. So, he made a T-shirt that keeps you cool, light, and dry, so you can push yourself further. And it changed the way athletes dress forever.

Today, UA makes a lot more than performance T-shirts—shoes that make you faster, gear that takes on the elements, digital tools to help you get healthier—but that commitment to innovation still lies at the heart of everything UA does. With offices all across the globe, the Brand is committed to inspiring athletes with performance solutions they never knew they needed and can’t imagine living without.
