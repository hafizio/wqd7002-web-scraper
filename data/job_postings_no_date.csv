We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Who we are
GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

What the role is
Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.

As a data scientist, you will:

· Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data

· Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products

· Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation

· Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team

The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.

· Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

· Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.

· Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

· Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

What we are looking for
We work mostly in Python, JavaScript and Scala. However, we do not require experience in any specific programming language or technology. Proficiency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us.

We look for people who:

· Have experience working with data and machine learning to solve problems

· Have a demonstrated ability to build software

· Can write code to solve abstract problems

Batch effects are usually only dealt with in late stage of analysis. We think there is value in early intervention. Using mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data, the first goal is to therefore, examine at what point resolution of batch effects provides greatest positive impact (raw data, peptide identification, inferred protein). Secondly, ambiguously mapped peptides are often discarded prior to protein mapping but also carry useful information regarding batch-effect loading, this project examines the cost, in terms of being able to estimate batch effect, of discarding this information source. Thirdly, missing values are common in proteomics data and are usually resolved by imputation prior to batch effect correction, imputation approaches usually ignore the batch covariate, such that batch effects can creep into proteins due to careless imputation.

Your primary role is in would be to help examine the extent of this problem. In collaboration with our lab members, you will also help develop solutions.

In addition, you will also partake in various machine learning and AI-driven initiatives involving the use of MS data in clinical diagnostics. You will have the opportunity to work on cutting edge data from next-generation proteomics platforms such as DIA-SWATH and DIA-PASEF.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Research Fellow Position

SGP Aviation Research

The Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) was established in 2009 in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to advance knowledge and nurture technically-grounded leaders and innovators to serve societal needs. SUTD has set aside a multimillion-dollar budget to spearhead our new phase of growth in three key economic sectors (Aviation, Cities, and Healthcare) supported by capabilities in Artificial Intelligence/Data Science. We will work with industry to develop a suite of integrated, multidisciplinary research & education programs for the future economy under the SUTD Growth Plan (SGP). For further information about SUTD/SGP, please visit our website (https://sutd.edu.sg/About-Us).

The Urban Planning & Policy Research Team at SUTD is seeking for researchers and doctoral students to participate in our “data-driven & evidence-based” research projects relating to: aviation; transportation & communication technology; land use policy; real estate market; local economic development; and urban infrastructure finance.

Project Overview

The Team starts working on one of the main strategic thrusts in a university wide interdepartmental excellence cluster between the aviation and urban sectors. The specific research, titled “ The Growth of Hub Airports as Employment Centers,” investigates the interlinkages between airport investment, employment creation/relocation, behavioral adaptation, and housing provision/stratification in the dynamics of urban systems. The scope of this research is outlined by the following four objectives:

Describing the growth (or shrink*) of hub airports with special attention to the spatial distribution of airport-related employment in selected cities;
Analyzing changes in the commuting patterns and housing preferences of airport employees;
Assessing the effectiveness of transportation–land use integration in accessibility and affordability improvements for airport employees; &
Drawing planning and policy implications for cities to manage the growth (or shrink*) of hub airports as employment centers on a sustainable pathway.

Note that this newly launched project would try to take into accounts the influences of COVID-19 on aviation-related industries to some extent and address critical policy challenges, drastic market changes, and emerging technological solutions based on empirical findings and possible scenarios for the sustainability of airport-centric development in the coming years.

Job Description

One Research Fellow will be hired to undertake the following research activities:

Disseminating new research findings in peer-review journals/conferences.

This full-time researcher position will be based at the Urban Planning & Policy Research Team, led by PI Prof. Jin Murakami, with support from the Aviation Studies Institute (ASI) and Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS) Cluster on the new campus of SUTD near Changi Airport in Singapore. As part of the research management and extensive collaboration, the Research Fellow is anticipated to work with an integrated team of faculty, full-time researchers, doctoral students, and part-time assistants and to communicate with industrial partners from development and aviation agencies.

The appointment is for 1 to 3 years, depending on candidate (*extendable, based on annual performance). SUTD offers a competitive salary that commensurate with experience, and benefits.

,,0,0,"The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) aims to transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an ""outside-in"" view, putting citizens and businesses at the heart of everything we do. We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

Join us as we support Singaporeâ€™s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Who we are

GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

What the role is

Product managers help make sure the right things get done. At a high level, this means establishing a clear vision for what a product should be and what needs to be done to get there. On a day to day basis, this means handling all the different facets of a project and making sure they are coordinated. And at the core, this means building a foundation of knowledge across user needs, technical constraints, and design goals so you can act as a bridge across all of them.

Concretely this means:
Making good product decisions

Working with designers to create intuitive user experiences

Creating multiple proposals for the many forms a product can take

Driving the team toward consensus on what the product should be

Understanding users better than anyone else

Conducting user studies to understand their needs and problems

Analysing data to uncover usage patterns that inform product decisions

Researching the industry to understand existing solutions

Work closely with the engineering team

Translating the product strategy into detailed, actionable plans for business and engineering teams

Communicating across teams

Explaining technical considerations to non-technical audiences

Public-speaking, giving presentations and writing papers

Identifying key stakeholders, including government agencies, industry partners and the broader tech community, and convincing them to give their support

Coordinating efforts across multiple functions including marketing, legal and finance

Keeping things organised

Running efficient meetings to keep people updated and make good decisions

Prioritising, planning, and tracking what needs to be done

Documenting key information and decisions about the product

What it is like working here

We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare.

The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on peopleâ€™s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.

Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means

having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

What we are looking for

The customers for our products are normally agency users, which means that prior public service experience will help. A disciplined approach and strong problem-solving instincts are fundamental to succeed. Your aptitude for completing the tasks and attitude to continuous learning are more valued than any formal certification.

We look for people who:
Have solid communication and stakeholder management skills

Can analyse and use data to solve problems

Have an interest in data science and machine learning

Have good design sense

Have experience writing code

Take initiative to make things happen

We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

Join us as we support Singaporeâ€™s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Who we are

GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

What the role is

As a software engineer, you will:
Build prototypes to demonstrate technology opportunities

Design system architectures

Write production quality code, and

Manage deployments to cloud and (occasionally) on-premise infrastructure

Learn and share knowledge in a multi-disciplinary team.

Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to:
Establish best practices

Share your expertise and mentor other engineers

Help with recruiting.

You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.

Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.

What it is like working here

We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare.

The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on peopleâ€™s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.

Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means

having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

What we are looking for

We work mostly in Python, JavaScript and Scala. We are looking for proficiency in at least one language and the ability to learn. Strong passion in software engineering is what matters to us.

We look for people who:
Have a demonstrated ability to build software

Can write code to solve abstract problems

Can think critically on how to get the code correct and cover the edge cases

Can talk and reason about code with other engineers

Have a demonstrated ability in writing efficient code

Adequate exposure to cloud or on-prem production environment, and experience in deployment would be an advantage

Understanding of devops, CI/CD would be an advantage

Have an interest in data science and machine learning

Take the initiative to make things happen

The Baby-LINC Lab in the Division of Psychology is headed by Asst Prof Victoria Leong. The lab conducts world-leading research on interpersonal neural connectivity between parents and infants, using a technique called “dual-EEG”. During early life, social interactions between infants and caregivers ""gate"" learning processes in the infant brain. In this project, the candidate will learn to analyse dyadic-EEG data concurrently collected from infants and their parents during naturalistic learning scenarios. The aim will be to examine how the parent-infant neural network is modulated by social cues such as eye contact and infant-directed speech in order to facilitate early learning. This project can be completed through 100% virtual coaching since a large amount of data has already been collected and is ready for analysis. However, should circumstances permit, hands-on training in EEG data acquisition may also be provided to enhance the trainee's learning experience.

About the Team

Our Data Science team consists of over 20 Data Scientists.

As Chicken Rice is to the people of Singapore, the Data Science team is to Gojek: providing the nourishment and power to sustain our business from the inside out. Our main responsibility is to build data products for ride-hailing, logistics, food delivery, and payments. How does one achieve this, you may ask? By leveraging on Machine Learning. From selecting the right driver to dispatch, to dynamically setting prices, to forecasting real-world events, to processing the hundreds of millions of orders per month across more than 20 products - all this is driven by Machine Learning. We are working on several projects now, including one about how we can strategically position our driver-partners to improve our customer experience.

As a team, we’re concerned not only with the growth of the company, but each other’s personal and professional growths, too. Along with keeping fit (via badminton and table tennis), our team bonds over our shared love of hiking (Yes, in Singapore!). With WFH becoming more normalized, you best believe we’ve been sharing our favorite ways to prioritize a healthy work-life balance at home (Netflix, anyone?).

About Us

Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and dozen other products. It is Indonesia’s first and only decacorn. It's also the only Southeast Asian startup to be part of Fortune's list of 'Companies That Changed The World.'

Our Mission: To create and scale positive socio-economic impact for our customers, driver-partners, business and MSMEs.

As of 2018, Gojek processed more than $9 billion annualised gross transaction value across all markets where it operates - in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. We have the largest food delivery product in Asia, (outside of China), and the largest payments wallet in Southeast Asia.

,,0,0,"The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) aims to transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an ""outside-in"" view, putting citizens and businesses at the heart of everything we do. We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Who we are
GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

What the role is
As a software engineer, you will:

Build prototypes to demonstrate technology opportunities
Design system architectures
Write production quality code, and
Manage deployments to cloud and (occasionally) on-premise infrastructure
Learn and share knowledge in a multi-disciplinary team.

Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to:

Establish best practices
Share your expertise and mentor other engineers
Help with recruiting.

You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.

Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.

What it is like working here
We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

What we are looking for
We work mostly in Python, JavaScript and Scala. We are looking for proficiency in at least one language and the ability to learn. Strong passion in software engineering is what matters to us.

We look for people who:

Have a demonstrated ability to build software
Can write code to solve abstract problems
Can think critically on how to get the code correct and cover the edge cases
Can talk and reason about code with other engineers
Have a demonstrated ability in writing efficient code
Adequate exposure to cloud or on-prem production environment, and experience in deployment would be an advantage
Understanding of devops, CI/CD would be an advantage
Have an interest in data science and machine learning
Take the initiative to make things happen

,,0,0,"The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) aims to transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an ""outside-in"" view, putting citizens and businesses at the heart of everything we do. We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Who we are
GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

What the role is
Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.

As a data scientist, you will:

· Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data

· Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products

· Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation

· Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team

Additionally, more senior data scientists will be expected to:

· Establish best practices

· Share your expertise and mentor other data scientists

· Help with recruiting.

You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.

What it is like working here
We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.

· Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

· Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.

· Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

· Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

What we are looking for
We work mostly in Python, JavaScript and Scala. However, we do not require experience in any specific programming language or technology. Proficiency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us.

We look for people who:

· Have experience working with data and machine learning to solve problems

· Have a demonstrated ability to build software

· Can write code to solve abstract problems

· Can talk and reason about code with other engineers

· Take the initiative to make things happen

· Want to work for the public good.",singapore,Singapore,https://sg.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=0713fccc2d14e40f&from=serp&vjs=3,Singapore,Data Scientist (Artificial Intelligence Platforms)

,,0,0,"Overview

The Office of Education Research (OER) of the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore, encompass 5 programme research areas in:

Cognitive, Emotional and Social Learning (CESD)
Lifelong Learning, Cognition and Wellbeing (LLCW)
Learning Sciences & Innovation (LS&I)
Schools, Leadership and System Studies (SLSS)
Teacher Professionalism and Learning (TPAL)

Since 1 April 2008, the Office of Education Research (OER) has led efforts to spearhead programmes grounded in the principles of advancing research, development and innovation at NIE. The Office is committed to providing the resources and support systems – through the governance, monitoring, quality assurance and dissemination of education research – that will produce high-quality education research with impact on policy and practice.

NIE’s research is guided by the Research and Development Framework – a policy-driven, evidence-based framework that guides academic and research staff to improve the quality of teaching and learning in Singapore schools and to build on NIE's standing as a leading international research institution.

The Office aims to conduct rigorous, relevant multidisciplinary research and development that inform policy, pedagogy and practice in Singapore and internationally. With a strong focus on advancing knowledge in the 5 priority areas above, the Office provides researchers with valuable research opportunities and platforms to enhance their global academic profile.

The Office is looking for Research Scientists to join their research efforts in the strategic university area in Artificial Intelligence Education (AIED).

Today, we are all operating in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) supported world. To be effective and successful in this kind of world, we need to develop the competencies, skills and dispositions to learn, relearn and unlearn in response to the changes in the workplace. To remain competitive in a VUCA world, the Singapore Government has initiated the skillsfuture movement to ensure that the “skills, passion and contributions of every individual will drive Singapore's next phase of development towards an advanced economy and inclusive society”. Skillsfuture for educators requires teachers to be literate with AI and its advancements and to consider how such emerging technologies can be embraced in the teaching and learning praxis.

NIE/NTU is a premier institution with strong roots in education and has more recently developed a wealth of research-practice nexus understandings on learning and learners’ cognition and emotion with the NTU schools such in medicine and the humanities. Hence, AI and Science of Learning (SoL) should co-inform each other. With NIE’s wealth of knowledge in evidence-based practices that are contextualised, effective and scalable for adoption in K-12 schools, it can potentially scale up AI and SoL research in education interventions. The role of research is thus to provide the evidence that guides the practice and, more importantly, to allow the practice to extend into new contexts.

We are interested in candidates with expertise in AI literacy, learning through/with AI supported or enabled technologies (e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, educational data mining, and etc) and AI enabled assessments and analytics.

Candidates with appropriate qualifications and relevant research experience are encouraged to apply. Successful candidates will work with a team of driven researchers in diverse areas related to AIED.

In addition, the Office provides Research Scientists with valuable research opportunities and the platform to enhance their global academic profile. The Office is dedicated to their interests by providing grant opportunities such as the Education Research Funding Programme (ERFP), a pool of research funds administered by the Office and supported by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Singapore.

Under Armour has one mission: to make you better. The Brand was created on a football field in 1996 when University of Maryland special teams captain Kevin Plank looked down at his heavy, sweaty cotton T-shirt and thought: there has got to be something better. So, he made a T-shirt that keeps you cool, light, and dry, so you can push yourself further. And it changed the way athletes dress forever.

Today, UA makes a lot more than performance T-shirts—shoes that make you faster, gear that takes on the elements, digital tools to help you get healthier—but that commitment to innovation still lies at the heart of everything UA does. With offices all across the globe, the Brand is committed to inspiring athletes with performance solutions they never knew they needed and can’t imagine living without.
